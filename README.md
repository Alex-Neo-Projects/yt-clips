# YT Clip Summarizer 
Sometimes it's annoying to take notes and watch youtube video's at the same time. Now you have a way to fully immerse yourself in the video and worry about the note taking later.

# Potential use cases
- Generate quotes and explanations of those quotes 
- Generate youtube video thumbnails automatically
- Scoring system based on the video + comments of the video
 
# TODO
[] Make sure yt-dlp is downloaded on server  
[] Do we need to download FFMPEG on server  
[] Keep mapping between youtube url to uuid so we don't have to keep downloading the same video over
