of silly word, but just find success or maybe happiness in career or just in life in general.

00:10.400 --> 00:17.280
Yeah, I would, the only advice I would have would be to not listen to anyone and to do what you

00:17.280 --> 00:23.520
love and to make things that you love. Whatever it is, make, make your favorite things. Be the

00:23.520 --> 00:31.360
audio, be the audience, make the thing for you, the audience, and it doesn't, it doesn't really

00:31.360 --> 00:35.200
matter what anyone else thinks. And if you have to get a job to support yourself so that you

00:35.200 --> 00:41.040
can make your art, that's fine. You can't make art for someone else, you can't make art with

00:41.040 --> 00:45.520
someone else in mind. I don't believe, I don't believe it can be good. So what does success

00:45.520 --> 00:55.520
feel like? Are you?
