00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,400
of silly word, but just find success or maybe happiness in career or just in life in general.

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:17,280
Yeah, I would, the only advice I would have would be to not listen to anyone and to do what you

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:23,520
love and to make things that you love. Whatever it is, make, make your favorite things. Be the

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:31,360
audio, be the audience, make the thing for you, the audience, and it doesn't, it doesn't really

5
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,200
matter what anyone else thinks. And if you have to get a job to support yourself so that you

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,040
can make your art, that's fine. You can't make art for someone else, you can't make art with

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,520
someone else in mind. I don't believe, I don't believe it can be good. So what does success

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:55,520
feel like? Are you?
