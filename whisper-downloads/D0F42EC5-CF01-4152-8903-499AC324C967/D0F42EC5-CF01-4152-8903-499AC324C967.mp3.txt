of silly word, but just find success or maybe happiness in career or just in life in general.
Yeah, I would, the only advice I would have would be to not listen to anyone and to do what you
love and to make things that you love. Whatever it is, make, make your favorite things. Be the
audio, be the audience, make the thing for you, the audience, and it doesn't, it doesn't really
matter what anyone else thinks. And if you have to get a job to support yourself so that you
can make your art, that's fine. You can't make art for someone else, you can't make art with
someone else in mind. I don't believe, I don't believe it can be good. So what does success
feel like? Are you?
