WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.760
Did you learn calculus and then get G a or did you cheat and get the a like it's like you know the answer

00:07.260 --> 00:14.240
Yeah, you're right. The a isn't the goal. It's the representation of your knowledge and your mastery

00:17.700 --> 00:22.280
This is Michael Seibel with Dalton called well today. We're going to talk about setting goals

00:22.920 --> 00:27.960
More specifically all of the pitfalls involved in setting or trying to accomplish goals

00:27.960 --> 00:30.960
That's sort of founders. We work with 10 to fall for

00:31.560 --> 00:35.920
Dalton, why don't you set this one up? Yeah, you know when we were talking about it this morning the the

00:36.720 --> 00:39.080
phrase or the meme that came to mind was the one

00:39.480 --> 00:41.480
Play stupid games when stupid prizes

00:43.160 --> 00:50.360
You know and again what I think it means in this context is if if you set goals or if you start playing one specific game

00:50.600 --> 00:55.160
That is silly to begin with or that hat that's like clearly a bad call

00:55.160 --> 01:02.080
Yeah, the prizes the implications of that the things that you win are going to be equally silly or

01:02.480 --> 01:06.760
Non-sensical or non-productive, okay, and so we see a lot of people

01:07.440 --> 01:12.360
Who set goals to in effect play play kind of stupid games? Let's talk about the stupid games

01:12.360 --> 01:17.320
And then we'll talk about the stupid prizes at the end. Those are those are maybe even more fun

01:17.840 --> 01:21.520
So you know, I think it's it makes sense to split this up into

01:21.520 --> 01:27.200
Mistakes that people make setting goals, and then mistakes people make trying to accomplish these goals

01:27.200 --> 01:29.680
So I would say like the first one

01:30.640 --> 01:37.360
And maybe I'll start with the simplest is when people set goals that are so aggressive they aren't motivational

01:38.080 --> 01:45.440
And they're basically missing the understanding of what the purpose of setting a goal is right like you want to motivate yourself to

01:46.480 --> 01:50.000
Act smarter faster more intelligently than you would otherwise

01:50.000 --> 01:54.520
And often them people are setting goals that are too aggressive

01:55.760 --> 02:02.280
Because they're motivated by fear you know in YC we see this all the time and what's an example of a too aggressive goal?

02:02.280 --> 02:04.280
Like what do you think I can give you an example?

02:04.280 --> 02:05.480
Oh, yeah, you know

02:05.480 --> 02:09.760
I'll see a YC founder who comes in to YC just starting to build their product and

02:10.640 --> 02:14.560
They tell me by demoday we want to have you know 30k an emerald and

02:14.560 --> 02:22.640
And we want to do that because some alum told us that like that's how much emerald you need in order to raise money on demoday and it's just like

02:24.560 --> 02:27.240
How many errors can be set in three sentences?

02:30.720 --> 02:34.960
What's an example comes to your mind my most common example is someone

02:36.000 --> 02:43.320
That believes once they launch a product it will immediately succeed and take off and so it's like we're gonna spend three months building this app

02:43.320 --> 02:46.200
We're going to put it in the app store. We're gonna launch and

02:46.920 --> 02:52.400
Then we're gonna get a hundred thousand D you yeah, yeah, it's yeah, like two weeks later

02:53.240 --> 02:59.480
Yeah, it's always the plan is they're gonna put it out and then it's gonna immediately take off those are always the goals

03:00.680 --> 03:01.840
that

03:01.840 --> 03:04.880
That are rough and what's funny is we're always like why do you launch sooner?

03:04.880 --> 03:07.720
So you have more time to make a grow after a launch is like no, no, no

03:08.280 --> 03:10.600
We're gonna spend all the time making it good

03:10.600 --> 03:14.640
And so they want to lose it's gonna immediately take off top the app starts a hundred percent

03:15.440 --> 03:21.760
Why would we launch something bad then it won't take off Dalton? Jesus. Yeah, we we we we we're gonna talk to some influencers

03:22.120 --> 03:28.980
You know, we're gonna do a social media launch. We've got it all lined up. We're have a wait list. So yeah top of the charts definitely

03:29.600 --> 03:31.600
game on so

03:32.520 --> 03:34.520
Both examples of being too aggressive

03:34.520 --> 03:39.640
I'm the next one that comes up a lot is fake metrics

03:41.400 --> 03:43.400
And we've talked about this a little bit

03:43.400 --> 03:45.320
But you know for companies who

03:45.920 --> 03:51.560
Charged their customers money somehow creating a goal incremented in something that's not money

03:52.880 --> 03:57.240
Hey, my product cost $10 a month, but I'm measuring registered users

03:57.240 --> 04:00.880
I want to hit you know a thousand registered users and it's like

04:00.880 --> 04:07.360
That's weird like hell if users is gonna be the metric like why wouldn't it be active users, right?

04:07.360 --> 04:12.200
Like just like if we're gonna be in that world. Well, that's too hard Michael. That's why fair

04:12.200 --> 04:18.040
But if we're charging them, why wouldn't it be the amount of money we make like that seems even simpler

04:18.880 --> 04:23.680
But I think you've seen a wide variety of fake metrics that goes way further than users, right?

04:23.840 --> 04:25.360
Yeah

04:25.360 --> 04:29.040
Okay, county and hits on your website. That's an oldie but a goodie

04:29.040 --> 04:33.960
Yeah, yes, yes, counting downloads, but not registrations is a good one. Yeah

04:35.400 --> 04:37.400
counting users as people

04:38.920 --> 04:42.080
That started the registration process and didn't finish it

04:42.880 --> 04:49.560
counting users as people that downloaded your product opened it closed it after five seconds and never open it again as users

04:52.960 --> 04:54.480
We've heard that one

04:54.480 --> 04:59.080
Just basically like a thousand and one different ways to avoid

05:00.680 --> 05:02.680
the actual

05:04.040 --> 05:07.320
Meaning of the metric which is to capture if it's working or not

05:08.280 --> 05:12.840
You know it's like every every which way people are so creative in finding ways to like

05:13.480 --> 05:19.880
Not actually measure the thing that they know they're supposed to be measuring and I can ever tell if they're doing it to

05:19.880 --> 05:26.840
fool themselves or to fool like investors or authority you I'm saying like it's hard for me to tell when someone is practicing

05:26.840 --> 05:34.440
Self-disruption that like number of downloads is the right metric or if they think that no one else realizes that that's obviously

05:34.800 --> 05:41.960
Like no one can tell what they're trying to do we can tell and honestly it's probably both right? It's probably a combination of both right like

05:41.960 --> 05:49.520
Um, okay, so here's another one that I see a lot especially with fundraising stupid comparatives so like

05:50.240 --> 05:52.240
in 2021

05:53.080 --> 05:58.360
Tiger gave this company a hundred million dollar funding when they accomplished blank

05:59.360 --> 06:01.360
500,000 of ARR

06:01.360 --> 06:02.840
therefore

06:02.840 --> 06:06.480
We will be able to raise a hundred million dollars of funding when we accomplish

06:06.480 --> 06:11.600
500,000 ARR right Michael right like there's no difference between you know

06:11.960 --> 06:14.960
Summer 2022 and summer 2021

06:15.600 --> 06:19.640
At all and that's how it works right is investors what they do is they just

06:20.080 --> 06:22.640
Are always consistent and they always

06:23.000 --> 06:29.600
Same decisions and it's easy for you to tell reading the tech crunch announcement. Why the investor made the investment

06:30.320 --> 06:33.120
Right, it's clear like I read the article

06:33.120 --> 06:39.720
Um, you know this VCE invested in this company were kind of like that company in some superficial ways

06:40.880 --> 06:42.880
It's in the bag we got it

06:42.880 --> 06:49.560
And then the other one that I love about it is like no Michael like that round was announced last week

06:49.600 --> 06:51.600
That just happened

06:51.600 --> 06:52.640
it's like

06:52.640 --> 06:54.400
sorry, but

06:54.400 --> 06:57.360
Lots of things are announced way after they happen

06:57.360 --> 07:03.360
And so again, well, I think what we're saying about what's the stupid goal in this case

07:04.240 --> 07:09.440
Playing the stupid game here is trying to create superficial resemblance to other things

07:10.320 --> 07:12.960
Yes as opposed to deep

07:14.080 --> 07:18.720
The thing is working or maybe there's a deeper analog to the other thing

07:19.360 --> 07:22.720
But if you're just focusing on the very surface level stuff

07:23.920 --> 07:26.160
Yeah, you're that is not a smart game to be playing

07:26.160 --> 07:33.280
One other example maybe an old one we talked about in the past, you know with Facebook where you might be able to argue

07:33.280 --> 07:40.000
Well, they raised money when they only had a small number of users right and then you completely punt on the fact that like

07:41.760 --> 07:49.360
That small number of users were 95% 2 hour a day Facebook users. Yes. So it was like the engagement was like

07:49.920 --> 07:51.120
incredible

07:51.120 --> 07:53.840
Yeah, if you can replicate Facebook's engagement

07:53.840 --> 08:00.720
Then you've got something versus replicating. I don't know. It's for college kids or I don't know people have very superficial

08:01.440 --> 08:02.400
um

08:02.400 --> 08:09.040
Stuff there. Oh god. You brought up one um on our list about sandbagging. Let's talk about sandbagging a little bit

08:09.600 --> 08:14.400
Yeah, so sandbagging. I don't know how much people are used to that term um, I think it's

08:15.200 --> 08:17.200
I think I it's a golf term

08:17.200 --> 08:24.720
But sandbagging is basically where you set goals that are intentionally way easy to hit

08:25.600 --> 08:31.120
With the goal of blowing them out of the water, right? So say you know you can accomplish something in one week

08:31.680 --> 08:36.560
The sandbag version of the goal is to get yourself a month and then when you go around and you hit the goal

08:36.640 --> 08:42.000
You like look like a genius and what's funny is when you are working for the man

08:42.000 --> 08:47.120
When you're working at a company like office space, you know, you're in a cube farm somewhere

08:48.000 --> 08:49.040
Um

08:49.040 --> 08:54.320
It makes sense to sandbag goals and that's actually great career advice. I suppose is that you you know

08:54.960 --> 09:00.480
You set really you convince people that something is really hard to do and then you see their expectations

09:00.480 --> 09:02.240
What a great way to get promoted or whatever

09:02.880 --> 09:04.880
Of course, whoever there's a problem

09:04.880 --> 09:08.480
If you're used to doing that and that's how you think all things should work

09:08.480 --> 09:12.160
When you start working for yourself when you were your own boss

09:13.040 --> 09:15.040
You are screwing yourself

09:15.200 --> 09:21.920
And what maybe a good strategy to like rest invest working at Google or Facebook and to just do his little work as possible

09:22.480 --> 09:25.200
By sandbagging goals and working three hours a week or whatever people do

09:25.840 --> 09:27.520
When you're the boss

09:27.520 --> 09:29.520
Do you see how that's like

09:29.520 --> 09:31.200
Not great

09:31.200 --> 09:35.920
Well, and you better believe that big company you work for didn't have that culture when it was starting

09:35.920 --> 09:41.520
Yeah, the founders of that company. We're not doing that. No, all right. Let's talk about accomplishing

09:42.000 --> 09:44.400
goals, so okay, let's say I set a good goal right I

09:45.280 --> 09:50.240
I'm a post launch b2b SaaS company with a couple users and I am

09:51.040 --> 09:56.480
Setting a goal of getting my first 10 paying users right great like we're in the right ballpark

09:57.120 --> 09:59.120
Let's hear about how people screw up

10:00.240 --> 10:03.360
Accomplishing goals and somehow kind of still play the stupid game

10:03.360 --> 10:09.280
Right out of the gate. It's the way that you accomplished it is something that you know in your heart is not

10:10.800 --> 10:12.800
like

10:12.800 --> 10:16.980
What's the word? I want to use kosher. I don't know. What would what would you use a Michael like?

10:18.080 --> 10:19.280
um

10:19.280 --> 10:22.080
I like using the word cheating like you know, it's like

10:23.760 --> 10:25.760
You're taking a calculus test

10:25.760 --> 10:33.760
Did you learn calculus and then get d a or did you cheat and get the a like it's like you know the answer to that question

10:33.760 --> 10:35.760
Yeah, you're right. The a

10:35.920 --> 10:40.320
Isn't the goal. It's the representation of your knowledge and your mastery

10:41.280 --> 10:43.120
If you didn't

10:43.120 --> 10:44.800
If you didn't

10:44.800 --> 10:46.800
Learn something when accomplishing the goal

10:48.480 --> 10:54.000
Maybe you didn't accomplish the goal. You know, you can fool investors. You can fool co-found

10:54.000 --> 10:56.560
You can fool while he's yeah, people

10:57.440 --> 11:00.400
Are very trusting and so I think the way

11:01.200 --> 11:06.320
The mistake people make is they think that because they fooled people in a short term

11:07.680 --> 11:09.920
They won't know they didn't hit the goal

11:09.920 --> 11:14.560
There like yeah, you know what I actually did was I got my friends and family to do probable or what I act

11:14.560 --> 11:17.040
You know, there's like something and where you're like yeah, this didn't

11:17.600 --> 11:20.640
Which you but no one else can be aware of us. You're like well, I guess

11:20.640 --> 11:23.840
I guess this worked. I guess this is how this goes

11:24.720 --> 11:31.200
So another way that people screw up the accomplishing goals is not understanding how to take the L

11:32.160 --> 11:36.320
Okay, maybe you set the wrong goal and instead of um

11:37.600 --> 11:40.000
Realizing that and setting a new goal

11:41.280 --> 11:45.680
You cheat or do you want to these other tactics to try to accomplish it because you feel as though

11:46.240 --> 11:48.400
Not accomplishing your goal as a failure in of itself

11:48.400 --> 11:50.480
Man, I find founders screw this up

11:51.200 --> 11:53.200
constantly. It's like

11:53.200 --> 11:55.600
You don't have to assume you're going to be good at setting goals

11:56.080 --> 11:59.920
Like you can give yourself some slack. Assume you're going to be bad at it and like

12:00.720 --> 12:05.760
You can adjust over time. You can set better goals over time. You can not accomplish your goals and learn from it

12:06.560 --> 12:07.680
um

12:07.680 --> 12:11.680
There isn't this you know sometimes in YC. I think people feel this like oh

12:12.400 --> 12:16.320
We're grading them on whether they accomplished their goals and it's like first of all

12:16.320 --> 12:20.080
We're not grading. We're not your teacher. We're not your boss and second of all like

12:20.880 --> 12:25.840
Your job is to work on the hardest problem your company like that like if you've made progress on the hardest problems in your company

12:25.840 --> 12:27.040
You're doing well

12:27.040 --> 12:32.320
Like that's the that's the whole gist of this. It's not like oh, did you like

12:33.200 --> 12:37.120
Release that feature when you said you were going to you know that no one's gonna use

12:37.120 --> 12:45.920
Oh, man, and then you talk about excuses a lot. How do how do people screw that up when they don't accomplish their goal?

12:46.240 --> 12:50.480
I just noticed a lot that when folks set goals and are able to hit them

12:51.280 --> 12:52.560
That's okay

12:52.560 --> 12:59.520
But when folks are in a position where they really think it's important to make a lot of excuses on why it's not their fault

13:00.000 --> 13:03.840
And everyone else's fault and they just have this like inner desire

13:03.840 --> 13:10.400
To like tell me all the excuses. I think that's not hopeful in that like again

13:10.400 --> 13:15.440
I'm not the bot like I don't care. Okay, you didn't hear go great. Let's move on like like like it

13:16.240 --> 13:18.240
It's like they want redemption

13:18.960 --> 13:20.960
And so I just think that it's good

13:22.640 --> 13:25.920
If something doesn't work to accept it to acknowledge it to look at it

13:25.920 --> 13:29.040
But realize you're the boss of yourself and you should just

13:29.040 --> 13:37.280
Not feel in need to make a million excuses or have like like create this long narrative where you're the victim and everyone else

13:37.680 --> 13:42.320
It's not your fault and your heart was in the right place and you did everything right but everyone else was wrong

13:43.040 --> 13:45.040
This is usually stuff about sales cycle

13:45.120 --> 13:50.560
Well, you know the sales cycle is just long like this is just too hard and it's just when people do this

13:51.920 --> 13:54.880
My message to them is like hey, that's fine. I'm not saying your excuses wrong

13:54.880 --> 13:59.280
But like why are you spending all this energy trying to plead a case like you're in court

14:00.320 --> 14:04.400
That the thing didn't work as opposed to like well move on and make something that does work. How about that

14:05.280 --> 14:10.000
spend energy in a positive proactive direction then

14:10.960 --> 14:16.400
Weave in the narrative of yourself is the person who did great, but you're misunderstood by the universe

14:16.800 --> 14:21.920
This is an internal tool like this is a tool for you to use your help yourself. This is not

14:21.920 --> 14:28.960
A tool for you to please someone else like that. That's kind of a relevant

14:29.920 --> 14:34.720
So let's do the takeaway here. You know you set this up with play stupid games win stupid prizes

14:35.680 --> 14:39.440
Um, let's talk about some of the stupid prizes that we see companies with

14:40.080 --> 14:42.080
Where do you want to start?

14:42.080 --> 14:44.080
If you set that goal

14:44.080 --> 14:46.080
If you start playing a silly game

14:46.080 --> 14:50.320
You can win at the game. We see lots of people win at the game and so one of the game one of those stupid games

14:50.320 --> 14:57.680
Sometimes people play is just how much money can I raise the more money I raise the better my goal is most dollars raised

14:58.400 --> 15:03.600
And the bigger that number is the better I am. So you're playing the game you won the game. Congratulations

15:04.240 --> 15:08.240
What's the prize you win Michael? What's the stupid prize if you play the race as much as you can game

15:09.120 --> 15:11.120
Often you lose control of your company

15:11.680 --> 15:15.840
So like when you confront the challenges suddenly, you know your board can fire you

15:15.840 --> 15:21.600
Often you find yourself burning tons of money because all people who gave you money expect you to spend it

15:22.320 --> 15:24.720
Um, oftentimes you have the wrong people on your team

15:25.360 --> 15:30.480
You've a bunch of people who think you've made it who think that this is you know the next Google when a reality

15:31.120 --> 15:32.720
It's it's it's not

15:33.840 --> 15:35.440
um

15:35.440 --> 15:37.440
And then last

15:37.760 --> 15:42.000
You might have to change what you're working on or change the problem or pivot in some significant way

15:42.000 --> 15:46.400
But now they're all of these people and all this money and all this momentum going down a direction

15:46.800 --> 15:53.200
That's driving your company off the cliff and that pivot becomes 10 times harder or or damn near impossible oftentimes

15:54.160 --> 15:55.280
Um

15:55.280 --> 15:59.840
But you did win the fundraising game. Yeah, it's a congratulations. So congratulations

16:01.360 --> 16:03.360
More than fundraising game here's your prize

16:03.360 --> 16:11.520
You have a messed up company that shouldn't have raised all the money and you've got to dig yourself out of a disaster

16:12.080 --> 16:15.680
And everyone's mad at you. Here you go. You won the prize. Have fun

16:16.560 --> 16:18.560
The next fun one is

16:19.120 --> 16:25.760
I want to feel like someone running a big company. I want to have 15 employees. I want to have 100 employees

16:25.920 --> 16:29.520
I want to have 500 employees. I want to be a boss of a lot of

16:29.520 --> 16:35.360
That's just a number of employees. I want a real big team. I want to move real fast. That's my game. Yeah

16:36.240 --> 16:42.000
It's always about moving fast. That's the lies like if we had this we could finally move as fast as like

16:42.560 --> 16:45.520
You know, we could finally build all the things that I want us to build

16:46.160 --> 16:52.080
So what's this stupid prize on that one Dalton? Now you wake up one day and you look at the spreadsheet of your burn

16:52.240 --> 16:56.000
And you you look at all the people that work at your company and you're like oh no

16:56.000 --> 16:59.600
And get what it's now your problem

17:00.320 --> 17:03.520
Because now you might have to do a layoff you might have to let people go

17:03.920 --> 17:06.320
You might mess up people's lives that believed in you

17:07.040 --> 17:08.320
You might

17:08.320 --> 17:11.440
Mess up that or have moral issues there

17:12.240 --> 17:17.520
It's like the worst thing ever to over hire and have to deal with it

17:17.520 --> 17:20.320
And if you talk to someone that's had to deal with this

17:20.400 --> 17:23.760
This is usually one of the more the biggest failures if you look at your life

17:23.760 --> 17:28.240
I know that's how I feel like personally is the biggest failures I've ever had

17:28.800 --> 17:32.320
We're definitely having to let people go that I shouldn't have hired

17:32.800 --> 17:37.040
So congratulations. You win the prize. You will hire a bunch of people. You're a big important person

17:38.240 --> 17:40.800
Now you're responsible for all of this

17:42.640 --> 17:44.640
Yes, yes

17:44.720 --> 17:47.920
Um, here's the other one. I love this one um

17:48.720 --> 17:50.720
Dalton I need an executive team

17:50.720 --> 17:57.760
It's it's time for my company to become a real serious company and to do that. I need an executive team

17:58.720 --> 18:04.080
And so I'm going to spend the next year recruiting the executive team like it's time. I'm ready to grow up Dalton

18:04.160 --> 18:05.920
I'm ready to grow up

18:05.920 --> 18:09.520
What do you think about this one? How many great executives have we encountered over the year?

18:10.080 --> 18:11.120
I mean

18:11.120 --> 18:12.320
Look

18:12.320 --> 18:17.760
I think if all you do is consume like VC content you're this is something idea that gets

18:17.760 --> 18:23.040
engaged in your brain and I think maybe there is a time where this is a good answer

18:24.080 --> 18:29.360
But it's like so much of the the VC content is aimed at late stage founders, which is pretty weird

18:30.160 --> 18:33.520
Um, it's like putting out content that's like you know

18:34.800 --> 18:36.800
How to care for your um

18:37.840 --> 18:40.800
Your Ferrari or something like like again. I don't really know who a lot of this

18:41.920 --> 18:46.080
The majority of the people that consume it are like two or three person startups

18:46.080 --> 18:48.080
And if you

18:48.080 --> 18:51.120
If all of your advice is like hire an executive team and you have like a three-person

18:51.600 --> 18:55.360
Pre-PMF startup like oh man, like you can get someone to leave

18:55.920 --> 19:00.800
You can get someone with a title to leave Google or Facebook or somewhere really impressive

19:00.880 --> 19:05.360
And you think you're like a big winner that you got someone from this cool company to join your company

19:06.000 --> 19:11.440
But then you wake up and you're like wow. What did I do? Like what usually happens is they either

19:11.440 --> 19:17.440
Are either they join your startup because they they weren't doing well

19:17.440 --> 19:21.360
I'm trying to give a nice way to say it either there's a reason they joined your startup and left Google

19:22.480 --> 19:29.360
Or they had expectations that you were farther or along or more successful than you actually are and they get very upset with you

19:29.760 --> 19:31.760
When they realize that your startup sucks

19:32.160 --> 19:33.360
tricky

19:33.360 --> 19:35.360
All right, the next one the next gift

19:36.400 --> 19:39.920
That you receive when you play a stupid game. We've touched on this a little bit is

19:39.920 --> 19:45.200
I'm now burning tons of money because I just scaled negative margins

19:45.440 --> 19:51.120
You know, I had something that wasn't working in this city and I expanded that thing to 30 other cities

19:51.200 --> 19:54.800
And now it's not working at a massive scale

19:56.160 --> 19:58.160
And I did it because my investors told me to

19:59.920 --> 20:06.000
And now those investors aren't taking my phone call and this is like so hard because I think people don't realize that either

20:06.000 --> 20:14.880
Some stage of investors or at some point in your companies someone's going to pull out your finances and do basic arithmetic and ask themselves

20:15.680 --> 20:17.680
Is this real

20:18.480 --> 20:23.760
And like eventually you will be judged based on like is this real and sustainable

20:24.720 --> 20:28.720
And if it's not like you know, hey sometimes you even get post IPO

20:28.720 --> 20:32.400
Oh my life at some point

20:32.800 --> 20:35.600
Those people are having a bad time. We're not going to name any name

20:37.040 --> 20:42.160
It's not being post IPO and then having your stock with 95% of its value

20:44.080 --> 20:49.680
I don't think not fun those people are having a good they play it a game and here's like the prize they have is

20:51.040 --> 20:54.800
Is having a rough time? So I definitely feel as though

20:54.800 --> 21:01.120
Founders make this mistake of like if I raise the last round by my massively scaling my negative margins

21:01.120 --> 21:03.120
I'll be able to raise the next round and

21:04.640 --> 21:06.640
That luck runs out at some point

21:06.960 --> 21:11.120
You know the next topic is on you know acquiring companies and and I think that um

21:11.920 --> 21:16.160
This comes in a number of flavors one is once again. We're finally grown up

21:16.240 --> 21:21.120
We can make our first acquisition or like we want to get good at this acquisition things

21:21.120 --> 21:26.960
So we got to start doing it. There's a lot of talent out there Michael and some really talented

21:27.440 --> 21:31.680
Failing startups would love to be a be acquired by us and this will help us grow faster

21:32.320 --> 21:36.480
So we're gonna we're gonna acquire them and by the way that doesn't mean that like

21:37.280 --> 21:39.280
acquiring companies is

21:39.760 --> 21:46.560
Bad it it just often means the folks who are thinking about it in startup land tend to be thinking about it too early

21:46.560 --> 21:51.440
Is this is like another example of like taking later stage advice too early

21:52.320 --> 21:56.800
When like the advice you should be taking is make your core business work like just make a core business

21:57.840 --> 21:59.840
If you don't have product market for yourself

22:03.200 --> 22:05.200
Probably not agree

22:05.200 --> 22:08.720
You're laughing but people are probably like wait really? Yeah, really

22:10.560 --> 22:11.760
You know I

22:11.760 --> 22:17.440
Belt and I uh you're right. I am laughing because that's like that's an inconceivable concept in my mind like

22:17.760 --> 22:21.200
Well, we're pre-product market fit. We should definitely be spinning up core dev

22:22.720 --> 22:30.800
Here's another one that's in the news more and more lately um defrauding your customers selling your customer something and telling them it's one thing and

22:31.920 --> 22:36.960
You know, it's not that thing and your customers lose money or your customers

22:36.960 --> 22:45.680
Are in some way extremely harmed. What's the prize for doing that Dalton? Um no joke. It seems like there's people

22:46.880 --> 22:52.240
Going to jail and getting arrested and people whose actual lives

22:53.040 --> 22:59.280
Are now irrepably harmed by the games that they were playing to get growth or to get money and

23:01.120 --> 23:06.480
Yeah, they're gonna spend you know best case scenario is spending years and years and years in court

23:06.480 --> 23:08.480
And then the court system and just having your life

23:09.360 --> 23:15.440
Changed like this isn't making a mistake. We're really clear here like your state of mind is is is is extremely important here

23:15.440 --> 23:18.560
This is like knowingly pursuing a strategy

23:19.760 --> 23:22.960
That you know as harming your users like

23:24.560 --> 23:26.560
and and um

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
I think what's tricky is that oftentimes

23:30.720 --> 23:32.720
People don't think this is happening

23:32.720 --> 23:36.640
I think sometimes people forget that they're not playing a game

23:36.720 --> 23:41.040
And I think especially in coven land. I don't know like one of my explanations is if you spend all day

23:42.000 --> 23:45.920
On Twitter and discord and everything's a game and everything to joke or everything silly

23:46.640 --> 23:50.080
You can kind of I just have noticed some folks lose themselves and not

23:50.720 --> 23:55.760
Realize that the numbers in the spreadsheet are real dollars and I don't know

23:55.760 --> 23:58.400
It's like we're not playing monopoly. We're not playing sellers at time

23:58.400 --> 24:03.120
And I think that this the the prize that you win is the knock on the door

24:04.000 --> 24:04.960
um

24:04.960 --> 24:06.960
From the police

24:06.960 --> 24:12.560
And that's when you're like oh wow this is this was real life and the last one our list

24:13.280 --> 24:14.240
um

24:14.240 --> 24:21.040
Playing the game of using your position as a startup founder to become an amazing investor

24:21.840 --> 24:24.560
And and I think this one's like really tricky because

24:24.560 --> 24:32.400
For one thing you definitely see a lot of famous startup founders have written kind of angel and checks in the companies that that

24:32.720 --> 24:34.000
tend to do well

24:34.000 --> 24:36.800
And so I think sometimes people confuse that

24:37.760 --> 24:41.920
For oh, I should be spending a significant amount of my time

24:42.880 --> 24:47.520
Looking around and trying to be an angel investor instead of making my company work and

24:48.240 --> 24:51.840
I think that what if I can try to explain to you what's actually happening

24:51.840 --> 24:53.840
When you're a good founder

24:54.560 --> 24:56.880
Oftentimes you know other good people

24:57.600 --> 25:02.640
And the opportunity you have to give them money requires almost no time or effort

25:04.560 --> 25:09.840
And so you just and and like if you're a good founder oftentimes people are are offering you

25:11.040 --> 25:14.960
To deals and so like you know you're spending five minutes saying yes

25:14.960 --> 25:18.960
This is an obviously good thing. I use it or this is my friend. I want to support them

25:18.960 --> 25:24.000
And the amount of time and effort you're spending writing these angel checks is basically nil

25:24.480 --> 25:26.880
Like you know, I remember when I was

25:27.440 --> 25:31.520
Starting social cam. I emailed Brian Chesky saying do you want angel invest? He was like sure

25:32.240 --> 25:38.240
That's it like that was like that was the entire time that he spent probably less than 15 seconds

25:38.880 --> 25:40.240
um

25:40.240 --> 25:42.720
I think people don't see this so they think oh

25:43.840 --> 25:48.240
I need to copy what I see investors on twitter doing. I need to go network

25:48.240 --> 25:50.240
I need to go meet founders and

25:50.400 --> 25:56.320
Advise them and do office hours and like all these things and it's like oh like classic example of cargo culting

25:56.320 --> 26:00.800
Right like not really understanding what's going on the stupid game your plane is the status game

26:01.120 --> 26:05.280
Like if you play status games where what you want to do is level up you want to

26:06.160 --> 26:08.880
Put angel investor in your twitter bio or something

26:09.520 --> 26:11.520
Okay, your plane is status game fair enough

26:11.840 --> 26:15.600
The prices that you win playing the game is congratulations

26:15.600 --> 26:21.760
Now a bunch of your money is tied up in ill-equid investments. The may or may not show up

26:21.920 --> 26:24.240
So now maybe you're like financially strapped

26:25.040 --> 26:27.440
Maybe you're worried about other stuff. You're worried about your startup

26:27.520 --> 26:30.320
So maybe you're performing worse because your money is tied up somewhere

26:31.280 --> 26:37.680
You have spent a bunch of time and stuff. You've totally pissed off your employees whether or not they would say it to your face

26:39.120 --> 26:43.120
That is not a great way to win awards with your team

26:43.120 --> 26:50.960
Yeah, you're a seinster. Congratulations. Yeah, so I think to wrap this up right

26:55.280 --> 26:56.800
Sometimes

26:56.800 --> 27:01.280
founders don't think enough about the bad consequences of the games they're playing

27:02.960 --> 27:07.840
And once they really do the whole logic tree down to the end they'll realize that maybe

27:07.840 --> 27:12.080
It's not worth playing those games and you might as well just build a good business

27:13.680 --> 27:17.920
And even if that's a tricky message for you to internalize

27:19.120 --> 27:24.480
Think about what you're teaching your team if you're making these mistakes right like they will copy

27:24.480 --> 27:29.280
What you're doing because you define success in your company and so even if you're like oh for me

27:29.280 --> 27:30.960
This is cool right like you know

27:30.960 --> 27:35.840
For example if if becoming a status seeking angel investor is like what seems cool in your company

27:35.840 --> 27:42.960
People in your company you start trying to do it instead of doing their work and so if they see a bunch number make sure

27:44.960 --> 27:49.360
Yeah, people in the company start doing it. They's like it's kind of like a little bit

27:49.440 --> 27:54.480
You know we're both parents. It's kind of like hey like if you don't want your kid to be a screw up

27:54.480 --> 27:59.200
You don't do screw up shit in front of them like it's like a pretty simple like

28:00.080 --> 28:02.080
one to one year

28:02.080 --> 28:04.080
um and

28:04.880 --> 28:10.320
On the flip side to kind of end with a positive note some of our best companies get so good

28:11.280 --> 28:14.000
At goal setting and accomplishing goals that they

28:14.960 --> 28:18.160
They move faster than we would ever imagine possible

28:18.720 --> 28:22.400
Like they are just machines at doing this well and

28:23.280 --> 28:26.400
I would argue that most people don't start doing this well

28:26.400 --> 28:32.000
Most people who focus on setting goals and accomplishing them get better at it over time

28:32.080 --> 28:34.880
But man the rate of improvement is sometimes shocking

28:35.600 --> 28:39.040
You know sometimes their founders were kind of fooling themselves who are thinking like hey

28:39.040 --> 28:41.520
I'm smart so I can coast on this stuff and it's like

28:42.720 --> 28:47.920
Man outliers are smart and great executors and great trainers, right?

28:47.920 --> 28:51.680
Like they have multiple things. They're great at they don't sandbag themselves

28:51.680 --> 29:00.080
Any of the thoughts here Dalton I think we're good. I think it's well said. Thanks, man. Awesome. Thank you later
